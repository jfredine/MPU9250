# MPU9250

This is a library for the MPU9520 9-DoF accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer.
It is essentially an MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyro) and AK8963
(magnetometer) combined into a single chip.

It does not expose all the capabilities of the MPU9250, but would be a good
starting point for further development.  It does initialization, allows for
selection of sensor ranges, and reads the sensor data.
